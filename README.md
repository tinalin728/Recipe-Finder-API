Brief:
 Cooking can be challenging, especially when you're living alone and looking for easy and exciting recipes to try. This project aims to simplify the process by providing a seamless recipe search experience. With this application, you can quickly find recipes based on ingredients, cuisines, and other filters (will be created later).


Challenges Faced:
Passing Props!
Passing props sounds simple in theory, but it gets tricky when I have multiple connected components. For example, going from Home to Recipe Card, then to Detail, and all connected Favorites made it a challenge to manage data flow and state updates. I had to plan how props were passed and shared carefully. There might be some tools like React Context or Redux that could help simplify this process and keep everything more organized (which i saw online), but I just wanted to focus on understanding the basic concept first.
